This is where I keep my configuration files.

What needs to be done when setting up vim and the whole environment is described in `dotenv.sh`.

To run this, make sure you make it executable before you run it: (FYI I haven't testing it yet, it serves as a form of documentation for the moment)
`chmod +x dotenv.sh && sh ./dotenv.sh`

Please note: some of the configurations here expect this project to be nested as per the following `~/projects/dotfiles`
