This is where I keep my configuration files.

Examples of links:
`ln -s ~/projects/dotfiles/vimrc.symlink ~/.vimrc`

This'll be if you're using UltimateVim (https://github.com/amix/vimrc) and have installed it into the .vim_runtime directory.
`ln -s ~/projects/dotfiles/my_configs.vim.symlink ~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.vim`
